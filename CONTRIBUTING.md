## 🤝 Contributing

This project is the product of passion, experimentation, and late-night coffee—not professional software engineering. If you're a developer with experience in PHP, image processing, security, or UI/UX and want to contribute, **your help is welcome**.

### Ways You Can Help

* Audit or improve security (sessions, uploads, input validation).
* Refactor monolithic logic into modular components.
* Help build a REST API for interoperability.
* Enhance frontend UI/UX or make it mobile-friendly.
* Add unit or integration tests.
* Improve accessibility or error handling.

Whether you're seasoned or still learning, your input could help transform ImageProof into something lasting and resilient.
