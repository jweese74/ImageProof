# üñºÔ∏è PixlKey

_PixlKey_ is a secure PHP-based platform for digital artists and content creators to upload, watermark, license, and register their digital artwork. The system ensures verifiable ownership, metadata preservation, and flexible licensing‚Äîtying these not just to the artwork file, but to its unique cryptographic fingerprint (SHA-256 hash).

## üéØ Project Goals

## üéØ Project Goals ‚Äî Implementation Snapshot

PixlKey‚Äôs purpose is to build a **searchable, decentralised registry of digital images, ownership rights, and licences**, anchored by each image‚Äôs **SHA-256 cryptographic fingerprint**.

That foundation unlocks four concrete capabilities:

## üìú Changelog

### [0.4.9-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-17
### Critical Security Task ‚Äì Rate Limiting for Auth & Downloads
- **New module** `rate_limiter.php` introduces `too_many_attempts()`, `record_failed_attempt()`, and `rate_limit_exceeded_response()`‚Äîsending RFC-compliant **429 Too Many Requests** with `Retry-After`.
- **Centralised thresholds** moved to `config.php` (`LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LIMIT`, `DOWNLOAD_ATTEMPT_LIMIT`, `REGISTER_ATTEMPT_LIMIT`, etc.) and are override-able via environment variables. A master switch `RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED` allows runtime-wide disablement for load-testing.
- **Authentication flows** (`/auth.php`, `/login.php`, `/register.php`) now share the same IP-bucket (`login_<IP>`) with 5 attempts/15 min default; counters reset on successful login.
- **Download & processing endpoints** (`/download_zip.php`, `/process.php`) throttle ZIP access/build (10 requests/min per IP + user + runId) and respond with `429` on excess, protecting bandwidth and CPU.
- **Account actions** (`/my_watermarks.php`, `/my_licenses.php`, `/index.php`) adopt conservative 10 actions/min limits to curb spam and abusive form submissions.
- **Optional audit log**: commented `error_log()` helper can output to `/logs/rate_limiter.log` for forensics without polluting stdout.

> Provides defence-in-depth against brute-force attacks and bandwidth abuse, while keeping limits configurable for future Redis/IP-hash back-ends.

### [0.4.8-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-16
### Critical Security Check ‚Äì Password Hash Verification
- `/auth.php`: Added `authenticate_user()` function using `password_verify()` for login and `password_needs_rehash()` to upgrade legacy hashes to `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` (bcrypt or Argon2id).
- `/login.php`: Password validation now includes hash upgrade on login using `password_needs_rehash()` with `password_hash()` if algorithm or cost changes are detected.

> Ensures all user authentication uses modern hashing algorithms with rehashing support, eliminating legacy or insecure password validation paths.

### [0.4.7-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-14
### Transport Security Enforcement
- `/config.php`: Enforces TLS-only access for all web traffic (403 if accessed via plain HTTP or misconfigured proxy).
- `/auth.php`: Forces `session.cookie_secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` via `ini_set()` before `session_start()`.
- Global security headers emitted:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

### [0.4.6-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-14
### CSRF Token Rotation (Privilege Boundary Hardening)
- `/auth.php`: Now regenerates CSRF token immediately after successful login via `login_user()`.
- `/logout.php`: Starts a fresh session and issues a new CSRF token after teardown.
- `/register.php`: Rotates CSRF token after account creation before auto-login.
- `/store_data.php`: Defensively generates a new CSRF token after session ID regeneration.

> Prevents CSRF token reuse across authentication boundaries or session transitions.

### [0.4.5-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-12
### UI Branding & Version Centralization
- Introduced dynamic branding via random tagline selection:
  - `config.php` now defines `APP_TITLE` and `APP_HEADER` with rotating suffixes (e.g., "Proof of Vision", "Own Your Image").
  - All HTML templates referencing titles or headers now pull from `APP_TITLE` / `APP_HEADER`.
- Version string (`APP_VERSION`) is now defined once in `config.php` (`0.4.5-beta`) and reflected site-wide.
- Updated `index.php` to use the new constants in the `<title>` tag and `<h1>` header dynamically.

### [0.4.4-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-12
### Session Security Patch
- Regenerated session ID immediately after **successful login**, **registration**, and **logout**:
  - `auth.php`: added `session_regenerate_id(true)` inside `login_user()`.
  - `register.php`: explicitly regenerates session ID before `login_user()` to mitigate fixation from pre-auth context.
  - `logout.php`: new session is now properly started and ID regenerated **after** teardown.
  - `store_data.php`: added redundant session regeneration as a defense-in-depth checkpoint before ingesting data tied to user identity.
- These changes harden against **session fixation** and **session swap** attacks across all authentication boundaries.

### [0.4.3-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-11
### Security
- üõ°Ô∏è Rate limiting added to login and registration forms:
  - `/login.php`: blocks IP after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes.
  - `/register.php`: throttles new user signups to 5 attempts per 30 minutes.
  - Prevents brute-force login and automated account creation attacks.
- Introduced new helper: `rate_limiter.php` using session-based attempt tracking.

### [0.4.2-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-11
### Fixed
- Thumbnail grid width now respects layout limits and renders properly in both public and member views.
- Broken image icon no longer shown in preview boxes when no file is selected.

### Added
- Placeholder preview frames for watermark/image preview.
- Header text restyled with Orbitron font and drop-shadowed PixlKey logo.

No changes to database, API, or core logic‚Äîthis is a visual/UI refinement patch.

### [0.4.1-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-11
- Security patch: `download_zip.php` now enforces user ownership of ZIP downloads.
- `process.php` now inserts `runId` entries into `processing_runs` to support ownership checks.
- `store_data.php` now verifies that the given `runId` belongs to the logged-in user.
- Sanitized and validated `runId` input with clear failure responses.
- Returns `403 Forbidden` for unauthorized access attempts in both download and store logic.

### [main reset] ‚Äì 2025-07-10
- Repository was reverted to `0.3.0-alpha` as the new `main` branch.
- All other branches (beta or experimental) were removed to simplify development and refocus on a stable base.
- This commit represents the official project baseline going forward.

### [0.3.0-alpha] ‚Äì 2024-06-29
- Initial alpha release and proof-of-concept build completed.
- Functional upload ‚Üí watermark ‚Üí package flow working with database integration.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8+, ImageMagick, ExifTool, MySQL/MariaDB
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS, dynamic HTML form generation, live processing feedback
- **Security**: Session hardening, CSRF protection, XSS filtering, SQL injection prevention
- **Persistence**: UUID-based relational schema with SHA-256 image fingerprinting
- **Optional**: `.env` configuration via `php-dotenv`; **Redis** (future) for persistent rate-limiting buckets

## üîê Security Enhancements ‚Äî Beta 0.5 recap

### Session & Cookies

* Session ID regenerated on **login**, **registration**, **logout**, and again before long-running jobs (`store_data.php`) to foil fixation/replay.
* All session cookies now ship with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* 32-byte cryptographically random token created once per session.
* Token embedded in every POST form *and* accepted via `X-CSRFTOKEN` header for AJAX/API calls.
* Token automatically rotated after each authentication event and on logout.

### Password Security

* Passwords hashed with `password_hash()` using `PASSWORD_DEFAULT` (Argon2id/bcrypt, depending on PHP build).
* Automatic re-hashing on login via `password_needs_rehash()` keeps algorithms current.
* `password_verify()` with constant-time comparison mitigates timing attacks.

### Adaptive Rate Limiting (`rate_limiter.php`)

| Protected action | Default limit | Decay window |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Login            | `5` attempts  | `15 min`     |
| Registration     | `3` attempts  | `30 min`     |
| Downloads        | `10` files    | `10 min`     |
| Watermarks       | `10` actions  | `1 min`      |
| Licence edits    | `10` actions  | `1 min`      |
| ZIP packaging    | `3` jobs      | `10 min`     |

* All thresholds overrideable via environment variables (`*_ATTEMPT_LIMIT`, `*_DECAY_SECONDS`).
* Global toggle `RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED`.
* Graceful **429** responses include `Retry-After` for client back-off.
* Optional audit logging to `error_log` for forensic review.

### Transport & Header Hardening

* **HTTPS is mandatory**; plain-HTTP requests return **403 Forbidden**.
* Global headers:

  * `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
  * `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

### Input Validation & Sanitisation

* `htmlspecialchars()`, `addslashes()`, and `escapeshellarg()` applied wherever user data touches HTML, SQL, or the shell.
* Upload guard: image files only, ‚â§ **200 MB** ‚Üí otherwise **413 Payload Too Large**.
* IDs and paths validated/sanitised to block traversal and injection.

### Filesystem & Process Isolation

* Each processing run lives in a user-scoped, time-stamped directory; internal paths are masked in UI/logs.
* Temporary files auto-purged post-process; periodic cron cleans aged processed folders.

### Provenance & Integrity

* Pre- and post-process **SHA-256** digests stored with artwork to detect tampering.
* Database includes placeholder column for future on-chain (blockchain) anchoring.

| **Docs & Ops**         | README security section updated; `.env.example` and sample Nginx config published.                                               | Dockerfile, CI pipeline, and automated cron-cleanup script.                 |
| **Provenance R\&D**    | SHA-256 digests stored; DB column reserved for future blockchain anchor.                                                         | Evaluate Arweave vs. Polygon for on-chain proof.                            |
| **Release track**      | **Feature-freeze** declared for Beta 0.5.x; only bug-fixes and test coverage improvements accepted.                              | Beta 0.6: accessibility audit, localisation scaffold, public API endpoints. |

**Bottom line:** core functionality is feature-complete and secure; we‚Äôre in a stabilisation sprint aimed at a public beta roll-out once automated tests, ops scripts, and performance benchmarks pass.
